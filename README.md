See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Testing github actions

Tune the Github pipelines in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows/).

To speed up the development, you can test the pipeline with [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
Installing `act` is beyond the scope of this document.

To test the pipeline locally and ensure that secrets (e.g., service accounts and other credentials)
are correctly configured, use:

```bash
# Run a specific job in the pipeline
act -j test -s CI_API_TOKEN="$(cat gh-ci.json)" \
     -s CI_ACCOUNT=my-secret-account
```

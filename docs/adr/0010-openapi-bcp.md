## Context

This project supports the publication of REST APIs for controlled vocabularies.
APIs are defined using OpenAPI specifications documents that should be valid
according to the Italian Interoperability Framework (ModI).

Data validation should be delegate as much as possible to the API specification,
to avoid legitimate clients sending invalid data, and enable
providers to use additional filters in front of the application service.

## Decision

- [x] Specs are defined using OpenAPI 3.0 in multiple files and bundled
  using pre-commit hooks and CI checks.
- [x] Common components are defined in a shared `components.oas3.yaml` file.
- [x] Specs are validated using Spectral with the ModI ruleset
  published in <https://github.com/italia/api-oas-checker-rules>.
- [x] ModI ruleset have been added to the repository.
- [x] To avoid duplicate validation, some API checks (e.g. Checkov) have been disabled.
- [x] Query parameters do not accept lists by default (i.e. set `explode: false`)
  according to <https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#style-values>.
- [x] Separate JSON Schemas between input request and response, allowing only ascii
  characters in request parameters.
- [ ] Use `cursor` pagination instead of `offset` pagination for vocabulary endpoints,
  to improve performance and reduce the risk of missing or duplicate items when the dataset changes.

## Consequences

Pros:

- Specs are more maintainable and easier to read.
- Published specs are assembled in a single, versioned, file.
- Specs are compliant with the ModI ruleset.

Cons:

- A periodic review of Checkov rules vs Spectral rules is needed to avoid missing important checks.
  Results should be shared with the <https://github.com/italia/api-oas-checker-rules> maintainers
  to improve the ModI ruleset.
